## 🧠 How It Works

DeepSeek operates using a state-of-the-art language model that's been trained on diverse datasets to understand and generate human-like text. When you send a message:

1. Your input is securely transmitted to our backend server
2. The server processes and formats your request for the DeepSeek AI API
3. DeepSeek's AI analyzes your message, considering context from previous exchanges
4. The AI generates a relevant, informative response
5. The response is sent back to your browser and displayed in the chat interface

All of this happens in milliseconds, creating a seamless conversational experience!
